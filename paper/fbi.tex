\begin{abstract}
While the Lieb-Schultz-Matthis theorem allows the existence of a fully
symmetric bosonic paramagnet at half filling per site on the honeycomb lattice, an
explicit construction of such a wavefunction is challenging and cannot
be achieved in a non-interacting system. Recently, Kimchi {\it et al.} constructed
such a wavefunction and demonstrated that it does not break any
symmetries and is not topologically ordered.
Here, we use recently developed tensor network tools to argue that this wavefunction, while
appearing completely featureless in the bulk, is not
adiabatically connected to a non-entangled state. This is achieved by exposing
non-trivial structure in the entanglement spectrum, including a gapless edge
described by a conformal field theory and degeneracies protected by the non-trivial
action of combined charge-conservation and spatial symmetries on the edge.
The phase thus constitutes an interacting, bosonic symmetry-protected phase
protected by lattice symmetries.

ALTERNATE: 

Strongly correlated analogues of topological insulators have been explored in systems with purely on-site symmetries, such as time-reversal or charge conservation. 
Here we study a quantum state of interacting bosons and show that it exhibits  entanglement properties which are protected by its spatial lattice symmetries. 
This state, a fully-symmetric insulator of bosons on the honeycomb lattice at half filling (per site), bypasses the Hastings-Oshikawa theorems through its integer unit cell filling, remaining featureless in the bulk. 
For non-interacting particles at this filling, the tight-binding description of the honeycomb lattice combines with its crystalline symmetries to trigger metallicity, as in graphene's Dirac nodes.
Here, we use recently developed tensor network tools to compute the boundary entanglement spectra and argue that this state, while featureless and insulating in the bulk, cannot be adiabatically connected to a non-entangled insulator. 
We find a gapless entanglement edge described by a conformal field theory and degeneracies protected by the non-trivial action of combined charge-conservation and spatial symmetries on the edge.
Modifying the tight-binding representation by adding sites while preserving lattice symmetries is incompatible with the edge mode entanglement cuts, suggesting that the lattice representation can serve as an additional symmetry ingredient in protecting an interacting topological phase. 

%While the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem forbids the existence of fully
%symmetric quantum paramagnetic phases on lattices with fractional
%filling of particles per unit cell, such a phase is in principle
%allowed with certain fractional numbers of particles per site on
%non-Bravais lattices, including half-filling on the honeycomb lattice.
%It has been shown that a non-interacting Hamiltonian of spinless
%fermions or bosons cannot have such a symmetric insulating ground
%state, and an explicit construction using interactions is challenging.
%Recently, Kimchi et al. constructed a wavefunction for bosons at
%half-filling that does not break any symmetries and is not
%topologically ordered--and in this sense is a featureless insulator in
%the bulk. Here, however, we reveal that this wavefunction exhibits
%non-trivial structure at the edge. We apply recently developed
%techniques based on a tensor network representation of the
%wavefunction to demonstrate the presence of a gapless entanglement
%spectrum and a non-trivial action of combined charge-conservation and
%spatial symmetries on the edge. We will also discuss the possibility
%of finding a parent Hamiltonian and analyzing the existence of a
%symmetry-protected topological phase around this state.
